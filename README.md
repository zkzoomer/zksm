# zkSM

Simple state machines designed using the [PIL](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/pilcom) and [zkASM](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkasmcom) languages from the [Polygon zkEVM](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez)

## Setup 

First you will need to install [pilcom](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/pilcom). You can do so by cloning the repo directly inside this one:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/pilcom
```

And then installing the module and building the parser:

```
cd pilcom
npm install
npm run build
```
